Saygex clicker is a queer-themed clicker game I made as my final project in webapps class.
It includes a bunch of inside jokes from the queer community, and has a wiki explaining them.
While the main site relies on JS heavily, the wiki is completely JS-free. Player data is stored
in localStorage, thus removing the need for a backend. In the future, progress sync through QR code
may or may not be implemented.
